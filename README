Patches for IBM's Identity Mixer library.

The license of the Identity Mixer library (LICENSE.Identity_Mixer) does not
allow us to distribute the patched library. Hence we use this repository to
maintain the required patches to use the library in combination with smart
cards.

In order to use these patches you will have to download the sources yourself
from the Identity Mixer homepage (https://prime.inf.tu-dresden.de/idemix/).
